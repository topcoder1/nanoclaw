## Data Sources

### 1. Activity Stats

Query the SQLite database for this week's activity:

```bash
sqlite3 /workspace/project/store/messages.db "
  SELECT action_taken, COUNT(*)
  FROM processed_items
  WHERE processed_at > datetime('now', '-7 days')
  GROUP BY action_taken;
"
```

### 2. Autonomy Stats

Calculate the percentage of AUTO vs PROPOSE vs ESCALATE actions.
Query approval_log for this week:

```bash
sqlite3 /workspace/project/store/messages.db "
  SELECT outcome, COUNT(*)
  FROM approval_log
  WHERE timestamp > datetime('now', '-7 days')
  GROUP BY outcome;
"
```

### 3. Open Commitments

```bash
sqlite3 /workspace/project/store/messages.db "
  SELECT description, person, due_date, direction
  FROM commitments
  WHERE status = 'open'
  ORDER BY due_date;
"
```

### 4. Graduation Candidates

```bash
sqlite3 /workspace/project/store/messages.db "
  WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT action_type, outcome,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY action_type ORDER BY timestamp DESC) as rn
    FROM approval_log
  )
  SELECT action_type, COUNT(*) as streak
  FROM ranked
  WHERE rn <= 5 AND outcome = 'approved'
  GROUP BY action_type
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 5;
"
```
